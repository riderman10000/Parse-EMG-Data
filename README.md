# Parse-EMG-Data

## Description
> This project is related to the Word detection using EMG signals. 
> Dataset are from the Project " **Towards Continuous Speech Recognition using Surface Electromyography** " by  *S.-C. Jou, T. Schultz, M. Walliczek, F. Kraft, and A. Waibel*

> Dataset for this project can be collected from http://csl.anthropomatik.kit.edu, only the trial version is choosen for this project

>Extracts top 10 most occurred words in the dataset of EMG-UKA-Trial-Corpus, both sound and EMG signals

![Top ten list](/images/Top_10.png) 

### Usage
Copy the files **parse words from speech.py** and **parse words.py** inside the dataset folder path_to_dataset/UKA_Trial_LabelsFixed/ and tweak to get the data you want.

But can unzip the **Top 10 Words.zip** and **Top 10 Words emg.zip**, then test your ML model to classify and predict the words.
